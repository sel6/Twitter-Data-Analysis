# Twitter-Data-Analysis

### Tasks completed

1. Fork repository to your github account
2. Create a branch called “fix_bug” to fix the bugs in the fix_clean_tweets_dataframe.py and fix_extract_dataframe.py 
3. In branch `fix_bug` copy or rename `fix_clean_tweets_dataframe.py` to `clean_tweets_dataframe.py` and `fix_extract_dataframe.py`  to `extract_dataframe.py` 
4. Fix the bugs on `clean_tweets_dataframe.py` and `extract_dataframe.py` 
5. Multiple times push the code you are working on to git, and once the fix is complete, merge the `fix_bug` branch to master
6. Create a new branch called `make_unittest` for creating a new unit test for extract_dataframe.py code.
7. After completing the unit test writing, merge  “make_unittest”  to main branch
8. In all cases when you merge, make sure you first do Pull Request, review, then accept the merge.
9. Data exploration and pre-processing: the codes you fixed at step 1 are the modules you will extend to perform data reading, pre-processing and data exploration and visualisations.
10. Topic modelling and sentiment analysis: write a code using scikit-learn, Gensim, or other packages and APIs to model the topics discussed in the tweets and their sentiments. You may use word clouds, k-mean clustering, etc. as a simple model for topic modelling.
11. Work with streamlit and SQL
